# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.

## Results
1. Three diffrent map layers with legends and overlays
2. Marker and tectonics with customized style
3. Every map layer uses diffrent data layer to show the 7 day earthquake magnituded
