# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.

## Results
1. Three diffrent map layers with legends and overlays
2. Marker and tectonics with customized style
3. Every map layer uses diffrent data layer to show the 7 day earthquake magnituded

## What was the most challenging part of this project
Publishing the webpage was challenging as the project repo did not have reference to the API key and the webpage was embedded into subfolder. In order to publish I had to create a new repo that has a reference to the API key and the index.html is part of the root directory.

## Summary
Using Mapbox API we were able to build a interactive map using JavaScript and D3 data library.
